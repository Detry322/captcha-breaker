captcha-breaker
===============

This is a simple CAPTCHA breaker I wrote. It only breaks a specific type of captcha.

Usage
-----

For now, `python captchabreaker.py`, but still WIP.

Install Dependencies
--------------------

`brew install tesseract`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run `./create_tests.sh` to download some captchas. You'll have to manually solve them. Solutions should be in the form: `<solution>.jpeg`. Example: `fv8w.jpeg`.
